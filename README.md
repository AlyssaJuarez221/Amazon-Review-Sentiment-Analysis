  ## Summary
In this project I compre the accuracy of VADER and ROBERTA, pretrained sentiment analysis tools, to determine which of the two is more efficent for determining the sentiment of Amazon Video Game Reviews.

## Overview
The task of this project is to determine which Pretrained Natural Language Procesing model (VADER or ROBERTA) is more efficent for determining the sentiment of amazon review. I do this by taking the dataset and running it thorough each model. After I do so I compare the success rates of each model against one another as well as other features to see which model overall performed the best. Overall the ROBERTA model performed better than the VADER

  ## Summary of work done
  ### Data
  * Type: Numerical & Text input
  ** Instances: 110798
  ** Features: 3
  
  ## Data Visualization 
  
  ##Models
  ROBERTA
  VADER
  
  
  ##Performance Comparison 
  While the Vader model was significantly quicker to get results, the ROBERTA model was more accurate. 
  
  ##Future Work 
  I would like to take this a step further to use the models on articles eventually. I believe these models with a few other tools will be able to take the sentiment of articles/social media posts and generate the general publics opinion on certain subjects.
